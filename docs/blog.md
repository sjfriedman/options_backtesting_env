### Blog workflow

The repo includes a notebook-backed blog post and exported assets for sharing results.

Locations:

- Notebook: `blog/blog.ipynb`
- HTML export(s): `blog/blog.html`, `blog/The Art Of Selling Leaps.html`
- Images: `blog/images/`
- PDF: `blog.pdf`


## Editing and publishing

1) Open and edit `blog/blog.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab.
2) Export to HTML (`File -> Export Notebook As...`) to update `blog/blog.html` or produce a new named HTML file.
3) Place images/plots used by the post under `blog/images/` and reference them relatively in the notebook.
4) Optionally export a PDF (`blog.pdf`) for distribution.

Tip: Keep large images optimized for web and consider adding captions/alt text directly in the notebook markdown cells.
