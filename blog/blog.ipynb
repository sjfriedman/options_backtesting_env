    "# The Art of Selling Covered LEAPS: Earn Premiums, Reduce Risk\n",

    "# Selling Covered Leaps To Safely Invest\n",
    "\n",
    "Covered Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) can be an attractive investment strategy, as the premiums earned offset potential losses from stock price fluctuations. While covered calls can help protect against downside risk, they also cap the underlying asset's gain at the strike price. Many new investors use calls to leverage their holdings, but shorting covered calls can help investors reduce portfolio volatility and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the potential benefits of writing covered calls, this article will demonstrate how to properly source and utilize options data to backtest covered call trading strategies. Due to the Federal Reserve's plans to lower interest rates, high-yield cash accounts will continue to face declines (In the past several years Wealthfront has dropped their APY from 5% to 4%). As these cash accounts diminish in profit, having a safe investment strategy becomes increasingly important for low-risk investors.\n",

    "## What Are Covered Calls and LEAPS?\n",
    "\n",
    "An American call option is a contract that grants its buyer the right to purchase 100 shares of a stock at a set price (the strike price) on or before the option’s expiration date. When you write a call, you collect a premium upfront. However, at any time between the sale and the option’s expiration, the purchaser has the right to buy the shares at the predetermined strike price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a LEAP is a long-term option that typically expires in 1 to 3 years. This longer time horizon often results in a larger premium for the writer. If a LEAP position is closed at a loss, that loss can offset current-year capital gains or be carried forward to offset future gains, depending on the timing of the close.\n",

    "### A Necessary Assumption on All Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "An option buyer technically has the right to purchase the shares at any point before expiration. Since options are priced with respect to the stock’s movement, strike price, and time until expiration, exercising an option early would cause investors to lose out on additional profits. For this reason, it’s reasonable to assume they won’t exercise the option prematurely. Additionally, if the stock price falls below the strike price, exercising the option would force the buyer to purchase the shares above market value. For this reason, it is assumed that the buyer will not exercise the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profit from writing a covered call can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Profit} =\n",

    "- $C_0$ = the premium received for selling the call  \n",
    "- The factor of $100$ accounts for the standard option contract size (each option typically covers 100 shares).\n",

    "### A Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you own 100 shares of a stock priced at 49.50 each. You decide to write a LEAP call with a 50 strike price that expires in 18 months and receive a premium of 5 per share.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stock rises above 50, you sell at 50 while still retaining the premium. In this situation, the option can be purchased immediately prior to the expiration, leading to a \"loss\" which will be mostly offset by the price of the shares. If the shares are kept, this \"loss\" can be used as a tax write-off for other capital gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that the stock price ends at 60 and that directly prior to expiration, the option can be bought back for 10.03 (estimated by $S_T - K$ plus a small factor due to the other Greeks). Profit can be calculated as the sum of the loss from purchasing the option back, the underlying stock gain, and the initial premium, with an added tax loss bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Profit} = -(10.03 \\times 100) + ((60 - 50) \\times 100) + (5 \\times 100) = 497\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Tax Write-Off} = (10.03 \\times 100) = 1003\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By purchasing back the option and holding onto the underlying shares, the profit and additional gains can be written off. When the shares are eventually sold, taxes will have to be paid on gains, but this can be done during retirement when an investor’s tax rate will be lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stock remains below 50 at expiration, you keep the shares and the premium. A necessary reminder is that any loss in the underlying stock will negatively affect the portfolio value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the stock price ends at 47:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Profit} = ((47 - 50) \\times 100) + (5 \\times 100) = 200\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this profit is less than that of when the stock ends above the strike price, it serves as a reminder that money was made during an 18-month period of negative returns.\n",

    "### Improved Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates the use of a LEAPS on QQQ and SPY over an extended period. This method offers reduced volatility and downside risks compared to holding the underlying assets outright.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "1. Risk-Reduction Metrics:\n",
    "   - Variance and Max Drawdown are consistently lower with the s30 strategy than the underlying assets:\n",
    "     - For QQQ, the strategy reduces variance to 15.74% and drawdown to -27.59%, a significant improvement over the underlying equity’s variance of 20.50% and drawdown of -35.63%.\n",
    "     - SPY exhibits similar trends, with the variance at 14.80% (down from 17.46%) and drawdown at -31.82% (down from -34.32%).\n",
    "   - These reductions indicate that covered calls smooth the returns and provide substantial downside protection during periods of market turmoil.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Profitability:\n",
    "   - The strategy yields an annualized percentage yield (APY) of 10.28% for QQQ and 8.16% for SPY. While these returns are lower than those of the underlying equities during bullish periods, they are generated in a much safer investment environment, appealing to conservative investors.\n",
    "   - The downside protection enables consistent portfolio growth while mitigating risks during volatile periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Value at Risk (VaR):\n",
    "   - The VaR, which estimates the potential loss in the portfolio at a 5% confidence level, is substantially reduced for the s30 strategy:\n",
    "     - QQQ: -1.35% (s30) vs. -2.08% (Underlying Equity).\n",
    "     - SPY: -1.29% (s30) vs. -1.68% (Underlying Equity).\n",
    "   - This improvement reflects the strategy's ability to reduce exposure to extreme downside scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tax Advantages:\n",
    "   - The ability to write off taxes, with cumulative amounts of 449,896 for QQQ and 318,530 for SPY, adds another layer of value to the strategy. These tax efficiencies can significantly enhance after-tax returns for investors, especially those in high-tax brackets. Remember these \"tax breaks\" are not real losses although the options are repurchased for a higher price, the underlying asset is kept at a higher value. The unrealized underlying asset gain can be sold post retirment or during years when investors fall into lower tax brackets"

    "## Future Work To Be Done\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the structure of this code, it is possible to implement different expiration periods, rollover, and purchasing strategies. While I believe that I created a successful rollover and purchase strategy, implementing different strategies could potentially yield better results. In addition, profits can be made while completely ignoring the benefits of LEAPs. By changing the period till expiration to different values, numerous strategies can be imposed. While these LEAP strategies are commonly done in wealth management, I want to continue to research other options strategies such as covered ratio spreads for both defensive and offensive positions. By safely utilizing options, investors can better reach their investment goals."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The covered call strategy using LEAPS offers a compelling approach for investors seeking to balance risk and reward in their portfolios. By capping upside potential in exchange for steady income and downside protection, this strategy delivers consistent returns with lower volatility and drawdowns compared to holding the underlying assets outright. The analysis demonstrates that applying the strategy to QQQ and SPY results in an annualized return of 10.28% and 8.16%, while additional reducing the risk. These features make it particularly suitable for conservative investors or those looking to stabilize portfolio performance during uncertain market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the strategy provides notable tax advantages, with the ability to write off significant amounts. These efficiencies further enhance the net returns, especially for high-net-worth investors managing taxable accounts who might have tax rates near 50\\% of their revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the strategy may underperform the underlying equities during strong bull markets, it shines in periods of volatility or downturns by safeguarding capital. This feature is especially evident in the 2020 market crash, where the strategy mitigated losses more effectively than a simple buy-and-hold approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking forward, this analysis lays the foundation for further exploration. Experimenting with alternative expiration periods, refining rollover criteria, and integrating other options-based strategies. Overall, the covered call strategy with LEAPS stands as a versatile and reliable method for achieving steady, risk-adjusted returns in diverse market environments.\n",
